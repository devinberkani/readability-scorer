# Readability Scorer

This is my completed Readability Scorer project from the JetBrains Hyperskill Java For Beginners learning track.

I found this project extremely useful for practicing regular expressions, reading from files, and using command line arguments. 

## About

This application allows the user to use the command line to read a file and gain insights about its data and readability.

## Additional Info

As with all of my completed projects in Hyperskill, all commits for the project progress are also located in the general java repo I use for all practice exercises/projects.
